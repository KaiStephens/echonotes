# echonotes - summarize lectures with AI

When installing you can chose to use the OpenAI API to create a transcription, or you can optionally install whisper locally (you would still need an OpenAI API key for summarization) This program uses GPT-4o-mini initially but can be changed in the aiSummarizer.py under model="".
